    "# Using Soundscapy for Binaural Recording Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In v0.3.2, the ability to perform a huge suite of (psycho)acoustic analyses has been added to Soundscapy. This has been optimised for performing batch processing of many recordings, ease of use, and reproducibility. To do this, we rely on three packages to provide the analysis functions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * [Python Acoustics](https://github.com/python-acoustics/python-acoustics) (`acoustics`) : Python Acoustics is a library aimed at acousticians. It provides two huge benefits - first, all of the analysis functions are referenced directly to the relevant standard. Second, we subclass their `Signal` class to provide the Binaural functionality and any function available within the `Signal` class is also available to Soundscapy's `Binaural` class.\n",
    " * [scikit-maad](https://scikit-maad.github.io) (`maad`) : scikit-maad is a modular toolbox for quantitiative soundscape analysis, focussed on ecological soundscapes and bioacoustic indices. scikit-maad provides a huge suite of ecosoundscape focussed indices, including Acoustic Richness Index, Acoustic Complexity Index, Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI), and more.\n",
    " * [MoSQITo](https://github.com/Eomys/MoSQITo) (`mosqito`): MoSQITo is a modular framework of key sound quality metrics, providing the psychoacoustic metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics currently available are:\n",
    "* Python Acoustics : $L_{Zeq}$, $L_{Aeq}$, $L_{Ceq}$, SEL, and all associated statistics ($L_5$ through $L_{95}$, $L_{max}$ and $L_{min}$, as well as [kurtosis](https://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kurtosis-A-New-Tool-for-Noise-Analysis-Wei-Qiu-William-J.-Murphy-and-Alice-Suter.pdf) and skewness.\n",
    "* scikit-maad : So far we have only implemented the combined `all_temporal_alpha_indices` and `all_spectral_alpha_indices` from `scikit-maad`; calculating them individually is not yet supported. `all_temporal_alpha_indices` comprises 16 temporal domain acoustic indices, such as temporal signal-to-noise-ratio, temporal entropy, temporal events. `all_spectral_alpha_indices` comprises 19 spectral domain acoustic indices, such as Bioacoustic Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, NDSI, Acoustic Evenness Index.\n",
    "* MoSQITo :\n",
    "    * Loudness (Zwicker time varying),\n",
    "    * Sharpness (time varying, from loudness, and per segment with DIN, Aures, Bismarck, and Fastl weightings),\n",
    "    * Roughness (Daniel and Weber, 1997).\n",
    "\n",
    "Soundscapy combines all of these metrics and makes it easy and (relatively) fast to compute any or all of them for a binaural audio recording. These results have been preliminarily confirmed through comparison of results obtained from Head Acoustics ArtemiS suite on a set of real-world recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consistent Analysis Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary goal when developing this library was to make it easy to save and document the settings used for all analyses. This is done through a `settings.yaml` file and the `AnalysisSettings` class. Although the settings for each metric can be set at runtime, the `settings.yaml` file allows you to set all of the settings at once and document exactly what settings were passed to each analysis function and to share these settings with collaborators or reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Batch processing\n",
    "The other primary goal was to make it simple and fast to perform this analysis on many recordings. One aspect of this is unifying the outputs from the underlying libraries and presenting them in an easy to parse format. The analysis functions from Soundscapy can return a MultiIndex pandas DataFrame with the Recording filename and Left and Right channels in the index and a column for each metric calculated. This dataframe can then be easily saved to a .csv or Excel spreadsheet. Alternatively, a dictionary can be returned for further processing within Python. The key point is that after calculating 100+ metrics for 1,000+ recordings, you'll be left with a single tidy spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Soundscape Indices (SSID) project for which this was developed has over 3,000 recordings for which we needed to calculate a full suite of metrics for both channels. In particular, the MoSQITo functions can be quite slow, so running each recording one at a time can be prohibitively slow and only utilize a small portion of the available computing power. To help with this, a set of simple functions is provided to enable parallel processing, such that multiple recordings can be processed simultaneously by a multi-core CPU. In our initial tests on a 16-core AMD Ryzen 7 4800HS CPU (Fedora Linux 36), this increased the speed for processing 20 recordings by at least 8 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In testing, the MoSQITo functions are particularly slow, taking up to 3 minutes to calculate the Loudness for a 30s two-channel recording. When running only a single recording through, this has also been sped up by parallelizing the per-channel calculation, reducing the computation time to around 50s."

    "    * `label` : What label to assign that metric. For instance, Loudness is typically `'N'`. When calculated, the statistics will be appended like so: N_5, N_10, N_avg, ... N_{`stat`} and this will be the column name for that metric. If you pass nothing here, then Soundscapy will fall back to the labels defined in `sq_metrics.DEFAULT_LABELS`. **Warning**: Some functions share a label (e.g. `sharpness_din_tv` and `sharpness_din_perseg` are both 'S'), if you run both of these and don't define different labels, one will overwrite the other.\n",

    "Finally, there is an opportunity to define arguments to pass to the underlying function itself. This is perhaps the most important part for consistency and reproducibility. This is where you define which standard is being used, what time or frequency weighting, or what spectrogram bins to use. These options are defined by the 3 analysis libraries used and are not documented fully in Soundscapy. When the `AnalysisSettings` is parsed, `func_args` will be returned as a `dict` with an entry for each option you'd like to pass. `func_args` is then passed as `**kwargs` to e.g. the `mosqito.sq_metrics.loudness_zwtv()` function.

On my machine, I have 16 cores and at any one time during this process, only two of those cores are running at 100%.\n",

The reason two cores are running in parallel above is because we're already running both channels at the same time for the MoSQITo metrics.\n",
