## [0.7.0]

Complete refactoring of `Soundscapy`, splitting it into multiple modules (`surveys`, `databases`, `audio`, `plotting`), and improving the overall structure and functionality of the package. Also added more comprehensive documentation and test coverage.

### General Changes

#### Added

- New `soundscapy/surveys/survey_utils.py` for shared utilities
  - Implemented `PAQ` enum for Perceptual Attribute Questions
  - Added `return_paqs` function for filtering PAQ columns
  - Created `rename_paqs` function for standardizing PAQ column names
- Centralized logging configuration in `soundscapy/logging.py`
  - Added support for environment variables to configure logging:
    - `SOUNDSCAPY_LOG_LEVEL` for setting log level
    - `SOUNDSCAPY_LOG_FILE` for specifying a log file
  - Implemented checks for Jupyter notebook environment in logging configuration
  - Added `set_log_level` function to allow dynamic adjustment of log level at runtime
  - Introduced global variable `GLOBAL_LOG_LEVEL` to manage log level across different environments
    - Implemented `setup_logger` function for initializing the logger with custom options
    - Set default logger to WARNING level with console output
    - Created `get_logger` function to retrieve the configured logger
- New processing module `soundscapy/surveys/processing.py` with enhanced functionality
  - Implemented `ISOCoordinates` and `SSMMetrics` dataclasses
  - Added `calculate_iso_coords` function for ISO coordinate calculations
  - Created `add_iso_coords` function to add ISO coordinates to DataFrames
  - Implemented `likert_data_quality` function for data quality checks
  - Added `simulation` function for generating random PAQ responses
  - Created `ssm_metrics` function for Structural Summary Method calculations
- Comprehensive docstrings and doctest examples in `isd.py` and `satp.py`
- New test cases in `test_isd.py` to cover refactored functionality

#### Changed

- Modified default logging level to WARNING for better control over log output
- Refactored `isd.py` to use new processing and survey utility functions
  - Updated `load`, `load_zenodo`, and `validate` functions
  - Refactored selection functions (`select_record_ids`, `select_group_ids`, etc.)
  - Updated `describe_location` and `soundscapy_describe` functions
- Refactored `satp.py` to align with new package structure
  - Updated `load_zenodo` and `load_participants` functions
  - Added doctest examples for all functions
- Modified `__init__.py` to initialize the logger when the package is imported
- Updated import statements across modules to use the new package structure
- Standardized function signatures and return types across all modules
- Changed to Rye as the dependency and environment manager for the project

#### Improved

- Enhanced error handling and input validation in database modules
  - Added type hints to all functions for better code readability and IDE support
  - Implemented more specific exception handling
- Optimized data processing functions for better performance
- Improved code organization and modularity
  - Separated concerns between data loading, processing, and analysis
- Enhanced documentation with more detailed explanations and examples
- Standardized coding style across all modules (using Black formatter)

#### Deprecated

- Removed `remove_lockdown` function in `isd.py` (redundant since the release of ISD v1.0)

#### Removed

- Eliminated redundant code and unused functions across modules

#### Fixed

- Resolved issues with inconsistent PAQ naming conventions
- Fixed bugs in ISO coordinate calculations and SSM metric computations
- Resolved issue where Jupyter notebooks were overriding the default log level

#### Security

- Implemented input validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities

#### Development

- Implemented a more robust logging system using loguru
  - Added ability to easily change log levels for debugging and development
  - Enabled file logging for persistent log storage
- Enhanced test coverage for core functionality
- Added doctest examples to ensure documentation accuracy and serve as functional tests
- Implemented consistent error messages and logging across the package

#### Documentation

- Added comprehensive docstrings to all functions and classes
- Included usage examples in function docstrings
- Updated README with new package structure and usage instructions
- Created this CHANGELOG to track all significant changes to the project

### Changes to Plotting Module

#### Code Structure

- Split the original circumplex.py into multiple files: backends.py, circumplex_plot.py, plot_functions.py, stylers.py, and plotting_utils.py (implied).
- Introduced abstract base class PlotBackend and concrete implementations SeabornBackend and PlotlyBackend.

#### New Features

- Added support for Plotly backend alongside Seaborn.
- Introduced CircumplexPlot class for creating and managing plots.
- Added StyleOptions dataclass for better style management.
- Implemented simple_density plot type.

#### Improved Customization

- Created CircumplexPlotParams dataclass for better parameter management.
- Added more customization options for plots (e.g., incl_outline, fill, alpha).

#### Enhancements

- Improved type hinting throughout the codebase.
- Added docstrings to classes and functions.
- Implemented PlotType and Backend enums for better type safety.

#### Refactoring

- Moved plotting logic from functions to methods in backend classes.
- Simplified scatter and density functions by leveraging CircumplexPlot class.

#### Removed Features

- Removed jointplot function (marked as TODO in CircumplexPlot class).

#### Constants and Utilities

- Moved constants (e.g., DEFAULT_XLIM, DEFAULT_YLIM) to a separate utilities file.
- Created ExtraParams TypedDict for additional plotting parameters.

## [0.6.2]

### Added

- Changed the name of the `calculate_paq_coords` to `calculate_iso_coords` to better reflect the function's purpose.
- Updated the formula for `calculate_iso_coords` to the more generalised form given in Aletta et. al. (2024).
